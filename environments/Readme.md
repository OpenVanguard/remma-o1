### Key Components:

1. **Base Image**: 
   - Official PyTorch image with CUDA 11.7
   - Includes CUDA/cuDNN for GPU acceleration

2. **System Dependencies**:
   - Essential build tools
   - Media libraries (for potential data processing)

3. **Python Dependencies**:
   - Installs from your `requirements.txt`
   - Adds Jupyter Lab for exploration
   - Includes Hugging Face Hub and Weights & Biases

4. **Project Structure**:
   - Copies entire project into `/app`
   - Sets Python path for imports
   - Creates cache directories

5. **Security**:
   - Non-root user (`appuser`)
   - Separate volumes for data and models

6. **Ports**:
   - Exposes Jupyter Lab on 8888

7. **Entrypoint**:
   - Starts Jupyter Lab by default
   - Can override to run training script
